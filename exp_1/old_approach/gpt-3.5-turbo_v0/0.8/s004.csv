Fashion trends are such an interesting topic, right? I think what really drives the popularity of certain styles is a combination of factors like celebrity influence, social media, and even current events. Like, when celebrities start wearing a particular brand or style, it tends to catch on like wildfire. Social media plays a huge role too, with influencers and bloggers showcasing different trends to a wide audience. And of course, what's happening in the world can also impact fashion trends; like how streetwear became more popular with the rise of athleisure during the pandemic. As for the future of trends, I feel like sustainability and individuality will play a bigger role. People are becoming more conscious of the environmental impact of fast fashion, so we might see a shift towards more sustainable and ethical practices.
