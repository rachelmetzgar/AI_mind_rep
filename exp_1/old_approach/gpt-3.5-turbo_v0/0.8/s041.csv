I believe you'll master it with practice and patience!

When it comes to pasta, I really enjoy making fettuccine alfredo from scratch. There's something about the creamy sauce paired with fresh pasta that just hits the spot for me. As for bread, I've been working on perfecting a simple sourdough loaf. The process is quite therapeutic, from nurturing the starter to baking the loaf just right.
