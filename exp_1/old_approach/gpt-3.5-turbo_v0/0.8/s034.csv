For me, I try to set boundaries and stick to them. Like, when I'm at work, I focus on work stuff, and when I'm with friends or family, I make sure to be present and enjoy the moment. It's all about being intentional with your time and making sure to prioritize what's important to you, you know? 

I also find that communication is key. Letting people know what your boundaries are and asking for support when you need it can really help in maintaining that balance.
