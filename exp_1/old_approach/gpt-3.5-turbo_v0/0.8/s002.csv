Well, social media is a mixed bag for me when it comes to relationships. On one hand, it's awesome to easily keep in touch with friends and family who live far away. Like, I can see what my cousin is up to in another country without waiting for a letter or a phone call, you know?

I agree that social media can be a great tool for staying connected with people, especially those who are far away.

It's not always easy, especially with all those notifications vying for attention, but I find that those real connections are worth the effort. How about you, any strategies you use to maintain that balance?""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""I completely agree, Sam. Being mindful of how we use social media and making a conscious effort to prioritize real connections is so important. I also try to limit my screen time and set boundaries, like not checking social media during meals or before bed.
