Do you have a favorite live performance or moment from Coltrane's career that really stands out to you?","You know, I haven't had the chance to experience Coltrane's live performances firsthand either, but I've heard stories from fellow jazz enthusiasts about the transformative power of his concerts. One iconic live moment that always stands out is Coltrane's rendition of ""My Favorite Things"" at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1963. The way he reimagined the song with his signature intensity and improvisation reportedly left the audience in awe. It's moments like these that truly showcase the genius of artists like Coltrane, you know? The ability to take a familiar tune and elevate it to a whole new level through live performance is truly remarkable.",4,4,"{""quality"": 4, ""connectedness"": 4}"
