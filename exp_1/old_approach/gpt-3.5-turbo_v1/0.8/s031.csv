Another tip is to invest in a good pasta machine if you can — it makes rolling out the dough so much easier and consistent.

On the other hand, it can be difficult to trust someone if they have broken our trust in the past or if they display inconsistent behavior. What are your thoughts on this?","Oh, I totally get what you're saying! Trust is such a crucial thing in any relationship, whether it's with friends, family, or even colleagues. I agree that honesty and reliability play a huge role in building trust. It's like, when someone is always truthful and you can rely on them to follow through on their word, it definitely makes it easier to trust them. But yeah, on the flip side, once trust is broken, it can be super tough to rebuild. It's like that saying, ""Trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair,"" you know? And inconsistency can really shake that trust foundation too. It's like, if someone's actions and words don't line up, it can create doubt and make it hard to trust what they say or do.
