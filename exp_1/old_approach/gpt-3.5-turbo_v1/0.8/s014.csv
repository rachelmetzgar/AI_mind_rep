If they're more formal and structured, I'll try to match that. If they're more laid-back and casual, I'll adjust accordingly. It's all about meeting them where they are to create that connection.\n\nOh, and another thing I've found helpful is asking clarifying questions. If I'm not sure about someone's communication style, I'll ask for examples or for them to elaborate on something they said.
