It's like a shared language that can speak to us regardless of our background or beliefs. The fact that we can all look at a piece of art and feel something, whether it's joy, sadness, curiosity, or awe, is just magical. It's like a portal into our collective consciousness, you know? And I think that's what makes art so important—it reminds us of our shared humanity and allows us to see the world through different lenses.
