I can see why her story and her approach to photography would resonate with you so deeply—it's that personal connection to the subjects and the time she lived in that really shines through in her work.

Another one that caught me off guard in a good way was a jalapeño peach salsa I tried at a barbecue—it had this sweet and spicy kick that was just so addictive.

Experimenting with flavor combinations and drawing inspiration from different cuisines is where the magic happens in the kitchen. One time, I tried infusing some traditional Italian pasta dishes with a touch of Middle Eastern spices like sumac and za'atar—it added a whole new dimension to the flavors that was really exciting. I also enjoy blending elements of Mexican and Asian cuisines, like incorporating gochujang (Korean chili paste) into tacos for a spicy kick with a twist.
