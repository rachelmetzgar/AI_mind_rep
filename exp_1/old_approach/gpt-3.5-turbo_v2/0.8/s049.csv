Social media does make it easier to keep in touch with people, no matter where they are in the world. It's nice to be able to see updates and photos from friends and family members who you might not get to see often in person. But I agree with you that it can also create a sense of distance sometimes. It's like you're connected online, but it's not quite the same as spending quality time together in person.
