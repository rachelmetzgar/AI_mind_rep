When it comes to historical fiction novels that have touched me deeply, one that stands out for me is ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt. It's not your typical historical fiction, as it's set in a contemporary university setting, but the themes of morality, friendship, and the dark underbelly of human nature are woven together in such a compelling way. The atmospheric writing and complex characters make it a gripping and thought-provoking read.

But when that trust gets shaken, whether through past experiences or just a gut feeling, it can be really tough to let go and trust again. Like, it's hard to erase those doubts once they're there.

The foundation of trust is indeed built through consistent actions and reliability. I think the biggest factor that determines how easy or difficult it is to trust someone is their consistency.

But when there are those mixed signals or past betrayals, it's like the trust just crumbles, and it's really hard to piece it back together. Like you said, it really does take effort from both sides to keep that trust intact. It's like a fragile thing that you have to handle with care.
