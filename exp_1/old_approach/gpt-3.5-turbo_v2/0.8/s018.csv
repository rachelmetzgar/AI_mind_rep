Actions definitely speak louder than words when it comes to trust. It's like, you can say all the right things, but if your actions don't match up, then it's hard to trust you, you know? And about forgiveness... that's a tough one. I think forgiveness can definitely play a role in rebuilding trust, 'cause we're all human and we all make mistakes.

Forgiveness can indeed play a vital role in rebuilding trust, especially when both parties are willing to work through the situation and learn from it.
