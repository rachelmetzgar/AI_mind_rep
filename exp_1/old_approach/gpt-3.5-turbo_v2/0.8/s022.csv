When someone is consistent in their honesty and reliability, it really does make it easier to trust them. It's like building a solid foundation of trust brick by brick. But when that trust is broken, oh boy, it's like trying to rebuild a sandcastle after a big wave comes crashing down. It can be so tough to trust again, especially when you start second-guessing everything they do. It's like you're on high alert all the time, wondering if they'll slip up again. It takes time and effort to mend those broken trust bridges, you know. Trust is fragile like glass, it shatters easily but takes a lot of work to piece back together.
