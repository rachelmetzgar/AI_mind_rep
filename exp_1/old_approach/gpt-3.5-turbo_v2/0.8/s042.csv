As for other mystery novels and fantasy books that have stuck with me, one fantasy series that I found truly unforgettable is ""The Name of the Wind"" by Patrick Rothfuss.

I couldn't agree more about the magic of architecture and how it unites us in wonder and appreciation for the incredible creations of visionary architects like Antoni Gaudí. Here's to keeping that shared dream alive and hopefully turning it into a reality in the near future. Cheers to the magic of architecture and the adventures that await us!","Cheers to that, my friend! The magic of architecture truly knows no bounds, and the way it can inspire us and bring us together is simply amazing. It's moments like these, where we can share our dreams and passions for places like the Sagrada Familia, that make life all the more exciting and meaningful. Here's to future adventures, shared dreams, and the beauty of architecture that continues to captivate us. Can't wait to see where our architectural journeys take us next!",4,4,"{""quality"": 4, ""connectedness"": 4}"
