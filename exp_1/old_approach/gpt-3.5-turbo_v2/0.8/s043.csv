Growing herbs has been such a rewarding experience for me, both in the garden and in the kitchen. One tip I've found helpful is to make sure herbs get enough sunlight, usually around 6-8 hours a day, for optimal growth.

I've also learned that regular pruning and harvesting of herbs actually encourage new growth, so don't be afraid to trim them back for a bushier plant.
